def fill_nas(df, column):
    '''
    Replaces the NaN values of a column (column) in a dataframe (df) with
    the value of the column median

    Inputs:
        - column (column of a pandas dataframe): the column whose NaN
        values we want to fill in with the median. It should be a variable
        included in df.
        - df: the pandas dataframe where column is and where we'll replace
        the NaN values.

    Output: nothing. Modifies the df directly.

    Creates in the dataframe provided dummy variables indicating that an
    observation belongs to a certain quartile of the column provided.
    Each dummy has the name of the column + a number indicating the quartile.

    Inputs:
        - column (column of a pandas dataframe): the column we want to
        discretize. It should be a continuous variable included in df.
        - df: the pandas dataframe where column is and where we'll add
        the new dummy variables.

    Output: nothing. Modifies the df directly.
