    "\n",
    "Once you've set up the improved pipeline, you should apply it to solve the following problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is to predict if a project on donorschoose will not get fully funded within 60 days of posting. This prediction is being done at the time of posting so you can only use data available to you at that time. The data is a file that has one row for each project posted with a column for \"date_posted\" (the date the project was posted) and a column for \"datefullyfunded\" (the date the project was fully funded - assumption for this assignment is that all projects were fully funded eventually). The task is to predict if a project on donorschoose will not get fully funded within 60 days of posting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data spans Jan 1, 2012 to Dec 31, 2013. You should have your validation/test set be a rolling window of 6 months (which should give you three test sets). The training sets should be everything from 1/1/12 to the beginning of the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code should produce a table with results across train test splits over time and performance metrics (baseline, precision and recall at different thresholds 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50% and AUC_ROC)"
